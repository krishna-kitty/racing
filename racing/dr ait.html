      <p>
        Aerodynamic design: Our car has been designed with advanced aerodynamic features, such as a front and rear
        wing, diffusers, and air dams, which minimize drag and increase downforce to improve stability and cornering
        performance.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Electric powertrain: We have implemented an electric powertrain, which is more efficient, environmentally
        friendly, and produces instant torque for better acceleration and performance.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Advanced data acquisition system: Our car is equipped with an advanced data acquisition system, which collects
        and analyzes real-time data such as speed, temperature, and battery status to optimize the car's performance
        and ensure its reliability.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Safety features: We have incorporated various safety features such as a roll cage, fire suppression system,
        and impact-absorbing materials to ensure the safety of the driver and passengers.</p>
